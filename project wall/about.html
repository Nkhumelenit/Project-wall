                 <font color=white><h2>Founding story</h2>
				 <p>I never thought I'd turn my passion into a bussiness, but my love for coffee drove me to share it with
                    others. I remember the first time I roasted my own beans, the aroma filled the air and I knew i had created 
                    something special. Today, we're proud to be a leading coffee company, still rooasting small batches with love and care.</p>
